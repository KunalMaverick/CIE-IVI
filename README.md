# Week 1 : 

- The host machine, crucial for our development environment, was equipped with Python 2.7, rendering the 'repo sync' command ineffective.
-  Faced with this obstacle, our team delved into the documentation to identify a solution. After thorough research and collaboration, we pinpointed the necessity to update the Python version to 3.8. 
- Despite the initial setback, we successfully upgraded the Python version, ultimately enabling the 'repo sync' command to function seamlessly. 

#### Following errors occured thereafter:
